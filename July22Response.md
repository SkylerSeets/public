What is a one-hot-encoded column and why might it be needed when transforming 
a feature?  Are the source values continuous or discrete? 
2.
What is a dense feature?  For example, if you execute 
example = dict(dftrain)
 and 
then 
tf.keras.layers.DenseFeatures(your_features)(your_object).numpy()
, how 
has the content of your data frame been transformed?  Why might this be useful?
3.
Provide a histogram of the probabilities for the logistic regression as well as your 
boosted tree model.  How do you interpret the two di
ff
erent models?  Are their 
predictions essentially the same or is there some area where they are noticeable 
di
ff
erent.  Plot the probability density function of the resulting probability predictions 
from the two models and use them to further illustrate your argument.  Include the 
ROC plot and interpret it with regard to the proportion of true to false positive rates, 
as well as the area under the ROC curve.  How does the measure of the AUC reflect 
upon the predictive power of your model?

Boosted Trees continued (with model understanding)
1.
Upload your feature values contribution to predicted probability horizontal bar plot 
as well as your violin plot.  Interpret and discuss the two plots.  Which features 
appear to contribute the most to the predicted probability?
2.
Upload at least 2 feature importance plots.  Which features are the most important 
in their contribution to your models predictive power?
