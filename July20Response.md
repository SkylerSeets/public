# QUESTION 1
My topic is a recurrent neural network that recommends (predict) anime based on an input watchlist based on what the user has watched. I believe that only recently have companies started to personalize their ads. I would instead like to apply this to anime, or Japanese animation. Much like how Netflix recommends shows based on what you have watched, I want to do the same but with anime. The problems that I believe that I will encounter will be getting an entire database of anime (MAL or Anilist), designing the neural network, and text processing. I like to imagine dystopian scenarios and sometimes even dream of them. For some reason, I have always been fascinated with how the world might look in a few hundred years. This type of recurrent neural network will be so important because how efficient it could be in eliminating the need to browse, saving time. Imagine not having to go out to shop but having a robot delivering an outfit to your home that you know will be about 100% accurate to your tastes. In the future, as this technology becomes more advanced, it could very well just take the entire human population and help each person choose a job (this is very scary but I believe that it will come). I will design this recurrent neural network to take in a list of anime watched. Inside the recurrent neural network, I hope to load in a database from MAL or Anilist and have the network take the current tags (Drama, Romance, Comedy, etc.) and classify a probability that you watch. After that, the network will search for anime that you might like based on these tags. If possible, I would like to have the computer give recommendations based on rating, a rating of 1 should probably not be included in something that a person likes. Also, on the flip side, the network should not recommend something that the community has decided is bad (probably below 6). The network generalizes this and then maybe outputs 5 recommendations to the user. As an extension, I was thinking maybe just having the pages automatically printed and having the user review them. I believe that this will be a large scale project, as I have no idea how to build a recurrent neural network. However, I believe that what I will learn in this class will give me a good idea. The part that will take the longest time is designing the neural network to work the way I want. This is a very complicated network with 3 or so restrictions to accomplish. Not only that, but it will also connect to a website and download information from it and analyze it.
