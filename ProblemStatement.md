Unless you have been living under a rock or believe in conspiracy theories, it has been almost 5 months since the coronavirus was declared a pandemic by the WHO. The impacts on our daily lives have been...unexpected. As such, I hope to apply what I have learned this summer in both DATA 146 and 310 to create a model that will take certain features and predict a individual's probability to die to the coronavirus. I hope that this can then be used to strengthen certain areas in hospitals that will increase everyone's ability to survive should they catch the coronavirus. I will also attempt to analyze survival rate in each state to see if the survival rates are higher in certain states. <br/> 

I would like to also state some problems and my proposed model. I plan on using the Titanic model repurpose that code. The Titanic model essentially does the exact same thing that I am trying to do. The Titanic model takes in multiple features and determines which features are important to an individual's survival as a percentage. Some problems that I anticipate running into is making sure that my dataset is properly preprocessed so that the model can actually use it. Another problem that I anticipate is actually getting the plots to run. I hope that this model can in some way help to shorten this pandemic.
