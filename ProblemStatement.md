*__Problem Statement__*: <br/>
Unless you have been living under a rock or believe in conspiracy theories, it has been almost 5 months since the coronavirus was declared a pandemic by the WHO. The impacts on our daily lives have been...unexpected. As such, I hope to apply what I have learned this summer in both DATA 146 and 310 to create a model that will take certain features and output its contribution towards survival. I hope that this model can be analyzed and increase everyone's ability to survive should they catch the coronavirus since they will know which features are more important and prioritize them. <br/> 

Additional Descriptions: <br/>
I will be repurposing the Titanic model where we analyzed whether an individual would die based on many features. I will gather [data]( I would like to also state some problems and my proposed model. I plan on using the Titanic model repurpose that code. The Titanic model essentially does the exact same thing that I am trying to do. The Titanic model takes in multiple features and determines which features are important to an individual's survival as a percentage. Some problems that I anticipate running into is making sure that my dataset is properly preprocessed so that the model can actually use it. Another problem that I anticipate is actually getting the plots to run. I hope that this model can in some way help to shorten this pandemic.

Write a Problem Statement.  Introduce your topic, quantify its significance, and describe 
the problem as a process.  Identify and quantify significant obstacles to solving your 
problem.  Demonstrate why your topic is important, and why the obstacles associated 
with your topic are significant both globally as well as within the context of your 
selected application. Describe and analyze the complex nature of the process you are 
investigating, including the system, the environment, agents and networks. Describe 
and analyze scope, scale and hierarchy of processes and sub-processes. Describe and 
analyze factors that contribute to quantified obstacles.  Describe and analyze process
