The list represents 3. The probability that this item is in each of the 10 classes (the 0-9 digits)

I know this because 2. The 10th element on the list is the biggest, and the ankle boot is labeled 9. It should be noted that the 10th element is actually the digit 9 which represents the ankle boot since the neurons are numbered 0-9 for a length of 10.
