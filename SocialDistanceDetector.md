# QUESTION 1: Was your social distance detector effective at detecting potential violations?
Yes, I believe that my social distance detector was effective at detecting potential violations. It's hard without a scale, but there is a correlation between what the model marks as safe and what the model marks as a violation. 

# QUESTION 2: Do you think this approach would be effective for estimating new infections in real time?  How would you implement such an approach in response to the COVID-19 pandemic we are currently experiencing?
I believe that this approch could be effective for estimating new infections in real time. At this time, I believe that there are too many variables in the spread of COVID-19 that a one size fits all solution could be effective. For example, just a few weeks ago at the Florida town hall meeting, I was shocked and amused at the people who gathered and talked about how wearing masks would restrict oxygen flow to the body. Not only that, but the homeless people who have no healthcare and no access to masks are at risk of infection. Additionally, people who ignore guidelines (our generation) and unknowing superspreaders who either don't know they have COVID or don't care also contribute to the spread. Implementing this could help people understand how much is too much, for example, not everyone knows how large of a distance 6 feet really is. This could help in that situation, however, this social distance detector does not address the problems mentioned above. 

# QUESTION 3: What limitations or improvements might you include in order to improve your proposed design?
One limitation that this social distance detector is that it does not detect masks. Masks significantly reduce the wearer's chance to infect another person. As such, I believe that adding a mask detector could be good in differentiating between the contamination rates. There are some experts who advocate 32 feet, and I believe that it is a good bet to those who do not wear masks, since bodily fluids such as sneezing and coughing are propelled through the air quite quickly. The social distance detector could be improved such that it can differentiate between those who wear masks and those who don't. Therefore, the detector could apply different rules (maybe 32 for non-mask wearers and 6 for mask wearers) to each person to make a better social distance detector.
