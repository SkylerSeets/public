# QUESTION 1
'''
According to Maroney, Machine Learning is using the computer to create the rules that governs a program using both input and output data. The difference
between traditional programming and machine learning is the orientation of the process of writing code. For traditional programming, the programmer looks
at the input and output and formulates rules that govern them and the write the code. For machine learning, instead of the programmer writing the rules, 
the machine will look at both the input and the output and find the rules that govern them.
